# Hello, Javascript

JavaScript (or JS) is a fully-featured programming language. It is today one of the most popular languages used for the development of web applications, and also for a lot of different programs.

It's a great second language to learn, as it introduces many new language concepts not found in languages such as Ruby. It will also let you reinforce concepts you've already learned.

In this first module, you'll learn the basics of Javascript by pairing through a series of exercises, either building on previous knowledge or discovering new concepts. You'll then build a more complex coding challenge using all of those new concepts.

## Learning objectives

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* Follow an effective process to learn a new language.
